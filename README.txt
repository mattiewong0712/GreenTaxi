[1] "Task 1.1:"
[1] "There are 1494926 data points, thus we would make analysis on these data."
[1] "Task 1.2:"
[1] "The histograms are saved in the same folder as the code files."
[1] "Through the histogram of all the trips, we find most of the trips are very close to 0, it may because of the incorectly record, or lots of person took the short distance trip. Besides, there is an outlier with the trip distance very large, we need to pay attention to that."
[1] "We assume that the trip with distance larger than 50 miles should be an occasional case and seldom occurs, the trip with distance less than 0.5 miles should be wrongly recorded since it against the common sense that person would take taxi with such a short distance trip, thus we remove these kind of trips to make analysis on the other trips."
[1] "So through the modified histogram of the trips (removing trips with distance less than 0.5 and larger than 50), we see most of the trips are still short distance trips. We can infer that most of persons in NY would like to take taxi even the trip distance is short."
[1] "Task 1.3:"
[1] "The daily mean of trip distance (in miles) grouped by hour are 2.5565,2.4489,2.4185,2.4049,2.5817,2.746,2.7548,2.4546,2.3165,2.3511,2.3183,2.2549,2.2696,2.2431,2.218,2.2158,2.1863,2.1291,2.1499,2.1897,2.2455,2.3763,2.5248,2.5796, from the 1st to 24th hour of the day"
[1] "The daily median of trip distance (in miles) grouped by hour are 1.8,1.795,1.73,1.7,1.73,1.74,1.81,1.645,1.6,1.65,1.62,1.5691,1.59,1.54,1.53,1.54,1.54,1.52,1.545,1.58,1.61,1.7,1.8,1.81, from the 1st to 24th hour of the day"
[1] "Through the mean and median result, we find the same thing as we find through the histogram, that is, people prefer taking taxi for short distance trip, like 1 miles."
[1] "We also compute the count of trips for each hour, they are 83822,68736,53751,42416,36667,26111,30862,51608,72986,79226,74383,72064,73550,73012,81964,91563,98910,108460,119747,119117,113787,107185,105550,100953, from the 1st to 24th hour of the day"
[1] "We can see that the traffic is high in the afternoon and evening, and the trip distance mean is relatively small during these hours. Thus to decrease the load of traffic and benefit the environment protection, it is suggested that the city could provide public bicycles to help people with the short trips."
[1] "Task 2:"
[1] "The model explaining the relationship between the tip rate and kind of trip is built as Tip_rate = -0.000353 * Fare_amount + -0.004941 * Extra_overnight_charge + 0.000867 * Tolls_amount + -0.057828 * Trip_type_dispatch + -0.002445 * pickup_time_zone_morning + 0.002673 * pickup_time_zone_evening"
[1] "This is model is reliable since it can explain the relationship significantly, by using the test data to predict the tip rate, we find the discrepancy between the true and estimated values is very small as 0.4%."
[1] "From the model, we can infer that the tip rate is highly related with the fare amount, overnight charge or not, tolls amount, whether dispatch trip or not, pick up time zone (especially for morning and evening)."
[1] "To get better tip rate, the trip should be a low fare amount, not overnight charge, high tolls amount, not dispatch trip type, occurs in the evening."
[1] "Task 3 (option 1):"
[1] "From previous analysis, we find there are some abnormal observations from the data:"
[1] "1. trip_distance is short, it against the common sense that one person would not take taxi for a trip less than 0.5 mile"
[1] "2. pick up time is exactly the same as drop off time, or the difference are less than 1 minute"
[1] "3. total amount is quite low or negative, it should be unusual that taking taxi cost almost nothing"
[1] "4. trip period is small while the trip distance is relative large or the opposite situation, for example, one trip has a distance as 603.1 mile while the time cost is only about 11 minutes"
[1] "5. tip rate is very large, for example, one trip has $300 tip while the total amount is 303.3"
[1] "And before build model, we already remove these abonormal trips to get good model fit."
